This project, entitled, "Around The U.S." is a project to demonstrate the basics
of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is made with the intention of introducing the concepts
of grid boxes, flex boxes, fonts, media queries, section definitions, modals, and
basic page renderings, along with other HTML and CSS concepts.

The end result of this project is the culmination of three sprint's worth of work,
in which the aforementioned concepts and list of technologies (list growing) are
introduced during through interactive lessons.

**Addendum to the video:**

My major challenge with this project comes from the fact that, as long as I've been
in the industry, I've always gravitated towards backend work--I'm definitely a software
engineer and not a web developer. I can honestly say that a lot of this content
was relatively new to me.
